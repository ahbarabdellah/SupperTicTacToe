# TicTacToe

SuperTicTacToe-Flutter, a fun and strategic adaptation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with the Flutter framework. Super Tic-Tac-Toe adds an exciting twist to the traditional game by challenging players to win not only in individual mini-grids but also strategically control the larger grid.
